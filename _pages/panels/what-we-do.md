From pre-production ideation to post-launch support, AI Guys are there every step of the way. Whether we’re improving enemy AI, enhancing procedural tools, or helping your team iterate faster with generative AI-powered solutions, we provide the expertise to elevate your game. At AI Guys, we don’t just build AI—we build the systems that make great games smarter, faster, and better.

At AI Guys, we specialize in creating intelligent systems that transform games into dynamic, immersive experiences. Our work is grounded in the belief that AI isn’t just a feature—it’s a tool that empowers developers to build smarter, more engaging worlds. From enhancing gameplay mechanics to streamlining development workflows, we bring the power of artificial intelligence to every phase of game creation.

Our expertise spans two core areas: classical AI and generative AI. In classical AI, we craft robust systems like behavior trees, goal-oriented action planning, and advanced pathfinding. These tools form the backbone of believable NPC behaviors and responsive game mechanics, ensuring that every enemy, ally, or creature in your game acts with purpose and precision. Whether it’s guiding NPCs through complex environments or creating challenging and adaptive opponents, we build systems that keep players engaged.

Generative AI, on the other hand, serves as a powerful tool for developers during the creation process. We leverage cutting-edge algorithms to accelerate workflows, from procedurally generating environments to optimizing resource-intensive tasks like asset creation and tuning gameplay variables. These systems empower your team to iterate faster, experiment more freely, and focus on delivering the best possible player experience. By integrating generative AI into development-time processes, we reduce bottlenecks and expand creative possibilities without compromising your team’s control.

What sets us apart is our focus on integration. We don’t just create AI systems—we ensure they align perfectly with your existing tools, pipelines, and workflows. Whether you need modular components that enhance an existing engine or custom solutions built from the ground up, our work is tailored to fit your project seamlessly. Our goal is to empower your team with AI that works for you, not around you.
