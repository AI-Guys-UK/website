At AI Guys, we don’t just collaborate—we embed. By aligning with your tools, processes, and team culture, we ensure our contributions feel like a natural part of your development effort. Together, we create smarter games with fewer headaches, giving your players the experiences they’ll never forget.

We believe the best results come from seamless collaboration. That’s why our teams are designed to integrate directly into your existing workflows, adopting the tools and processes you already know and trust. From the moment we join your project, we become an extension of your team, working hand-in-hand to bring your vision to life.

We’re experienced in all the industry-standard methodologies and tools that drive game development forward. Whether your team uses Jira or Trello for task management, Perforce or Git for version control, or Slack, Teams, or other platforms for communication, we adapt to your setup. Our familiarity with these tools ensures a smooth onboarding process and immediate productivity.

Our approach is collaborative and iterative. We excel in agile workflows, breaking work into manageable increments and prioritizing tasks based on your goals and timelines. Need us to join daily stand-ups, sprint planning sessions, or retrospectives? We’re there, fully engaged and contributing from day one. We know that flexibility is key, and we align with your team’s rhythm to keep the development process efficient and focused.

From a technical standpoint, we design our systems to fit effortlessly into your pipeline. Whether we’re extending an existing AI framework or building new tools from scratch, our work is tailored to match your coding standards and practices. We ensure everything we deliver is modular, scalable, and ready to integrate with the broader project.
